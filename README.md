### Overview <a class = 'anchor' id = 'overview'></a>
Great Day Notebook is an e-commerce business co-founded by Ngo Quang Truong and Nguyen Che Phong. The project aims to provide young people with products and notebooks featuring note-taking, to-do lists, and daily/monthly planning functions. To expand its business across various digital platforms, Great Day Notebook has decided to build a website using WordPress. The website will be equipped with all the necessary features for an e-commerce platform.

Great Day Notebook has designed a database system to facilitate data storage and retrieval in the future. The team has modeled the database using dbdiagram.io, incorporating the most important entities for an e-commerce website.

To provide a visual representation of the system, the team has documented several functions the system offers to users. This includes workflows of various processes, interactions between system objects over time, and descriptions of the system's classes, attributes, and methods using UML models.

So now thanks for viewing my repositories. Should you have any inquiries or require additional information regarding this project, please feel free to reach out to me. I am available to provide any necessary assistance
